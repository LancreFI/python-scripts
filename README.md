Just an awful mess atm. Something I whipped up while doing some investigation into mbox content and needed someting to parse them with, without using an actual client.

The HTML-exctract depends on:
 bootstrap.min.css
 jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js
 bootstrap.min.js

At the moment creates everything into the folder it was run from. Maybe one day I have time to organize the code, do proper division to functions and classes etc. but not today.
