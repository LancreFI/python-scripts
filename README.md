#mbox-parser.py</br>

  The HTML-exctract depends on:</br>
    bootstrap.min.css</br>
    jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js</br>
    bootstrap.min.js</br>
</br>
At the moment creates everything inside the folder it was run from into the output folder, under the mailbox name. Maybe one day I have time to organize the code, do proper division to functions and classes etc. but not today.
